<h3>#ImVotingFor</h3>
<p>I created this graphic and posted it on election day to remind my peers to vote. In the image I included some representations of the politcal issues most important to me.</p>

<h3>St. Croix River</h3>
<p>This graphic was a design created for resale stickers of the St. Croix River. I grew up on the river in the summers and was really excited to portray the how beautiful it is in this design!</p>
