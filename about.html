	<h2>My Background</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Jessica and I'm from River Falls, WI. My hometown is just an hour outside the Twin Cities area of St. Paul and Minneapolis! Ever since I was little I have enjoyed taking pictures and video to capture my perspective of the things around me. On any family vacation I would be sure to pack my camera so that I could look back on all of my memories from these trips. As soon as I had entered high school, I involved myself in leadership roles that would work together with my progressing skills in photography and videography. My favorite experience was becoming the social media head for our high school's first coffee shop where I developed my graphic design skills as well as recored photos for the special moments. Now, I am continually excited to be studying the choices I can make as a content creator at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as a Communication Arts major! I have been able to write, direct, and shoot some of my own visions and love to keep refining these skills.</p>
